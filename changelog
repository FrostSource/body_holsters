Update 8 (v2.0.0)

Updated to AlyxLib v2.0.0

Added body holsters tab for AlyxLib debug menu

Added body_holsters_use_actual_weapons (on by default) to allow accurate visible weapon display. Uses the real weapon entities so any addon modifications should also apply.
body_holsters_visible_weapons is still OFF by default, so make sure you turn it on if you want to see the new weapons.

Added body_holsters_animate (on by default) to give holstered weapons a smooth transition into place.

Fixed cough handpose sticking hand to face.

Updated slot positions.

Added dynamic repositioning and angle slots based on handedness (only applies on map load).

Update 7

Updated to AlyxLib v1.3.0

Added new convars to customize the analog and digital actions for holstering and unholstering:

[list]
[*]body_holsters_holster_is_analog
[*]body_holsters_holster_action
[*]body_holsters_unholster_is_analog
[*]body_holsters_unholster_action
[/list]

Please see this guide for more info: https://steamcommunity.com/workshop/filedetails/discussion/3144612716/732500995379036779/

Removed two convars that are no longer used due to the new customize convars:

[list]
[*]body_holsters_require_trigger_to_unholster
[*]body_holsters_knuckles_use_squeeze
[/list]

Updated sounds to use inventory mixgroup so they should match the environment and be more immersive.

Fixed backpack being disabled when trying to store ammo while a shoulder slot is holstered.

Fixed magazine sometimes coming out when unholstering shoulder weapon.

Fixed some controllers using the grenade button instead of the grip by default (hopefully).

Added default buttons for the Vive controller.

Added a new diagnostic function using AlyxLib â€” use [b]alyxlib_diagnose body_holsters[/b] to check for any issues.

Adjusted slot positions to be less finicky.

Update 6

This addon has been completely overhauled to use the new AlyxLib scripting system. It requires the AlyxLib addon to be downloaded and enabled.

Completely reworked the inputs for holstering/unholstering. This should make things much more consistent across different VR headsets and allows for greater customization.

Added default angles for all slots so the weapons appear to sit more naturally.

Removed 'body_holsters_require_use_to_holster' convar due to the way the new system works.

Fixed a hand model appearing with the holstered weapon sometimes.

Added 'body_holsters_unholster_grip_amount' convar to change the amount your hand must be gripped in order to unholster a weapon.

Added 'body_holsters_holster_ungrip_amount' convar to change the amount your hand must be ungripped in order to holster a weapon.

Added 'body_holsters_knuckles_use_squeeze' convar for Valve Index users to choose whether they want to use squeezing or traditional grip.

Added 'body_holsters_use_procedural_angles' convar to allow user defined angles when holstering a weapon.


Known Issues:

Ammo displays on visible holstered weapons will show incorrect amount of ammo. Unfortunately I have not found a way to get the current ammo inside a weapon.

Trying to grab a weapon near the face while wearing a mask or respirator will cause the player to accidentally remove the worn item instead of the weapon. Unfortunately I have not found a way to get around this.


[b]The transition to the new AlyxLib API is a complex update so please bear with me during this time. I do this as a hobby and cannot always dedicate my time to fixes.[/b]

Update 5

Attempted fix for the cough handpose causing hand to stick to face after holstering.

Added Quality of Life tag.

Update 4

Fixed weapons not being unholstered from previous body slot if holstered into a new slot after equipping from the inventory menu.

Added invalid sound when trying to holster in occupied slot.

Added dynamic slot adjustment based on head pitch.
When you look down your head origin moves forwards but body and arms stay in the same place.
This causes a perceived disparity between where the slots actually are versus where you think they should be.

Added a new chest slot, right at the center of your chest.

Added new convar "body_holsters_increase_offhand_side_radius"
Players have less reach to the non-dominant side of the body.
If "body_holsters_increase_offhand_side_radius" is true then non-dominant side slots will increase their radius slightly to accommodate.

Update 3

Further fix for Scalable Init Support.

Due to the issue only being present in workshop downloads, updates will continue as I narrow down the exact cause.

Update 2

Fixed script discrepancy which stopped Scalable Init Support from working. The Resin Watch mod now works alongside Body Holsters.

Update 1

Added new convar to require use release for holstering. This is an initial attempt at fixing the Quest controller bug.
