[i]Console commands have been moved here due to a character limit on the workshop description.[/i]

Console commands allow you to customize and tweak the addon while playing. They are not required to use the addon, and for most users the default values will provide a good experience. 

If you don't know how to use the console, follow this guide: https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2040205272
